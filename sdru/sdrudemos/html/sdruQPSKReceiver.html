Set the MATLAB variable compileIt to true in order to generate C code; this can be accomplished by using the <b>codegen</b> command provided by the MATLAB Coder&#8482; product. The <b>codegen</b> command compiles MATLAB&reg; functions to a C-based static or dynamic library, executable, or MEX file, producing code for accelerated execution. The generated executable runs several times faster than the original MATLAB code. Set useCodegen to true to run the executable generated by <b>codegen</b> instead of the MATLAB code.</p><h2>Code Architecture<a name="5"></a></h2><p>The function runSDRuQPSKReceiver implements the QPSK receiver using two System objects, QPSKReceiver and comm.SDRuReceiver.</p><p><b>SDRu Receiver</b></p><p>This example communicates with the USRP&reg; board using the SDRu receiver System object. You can supply the IP address of the USRP&reg; board as an argument when you construct the object. The IP address can be any address within the same sub-network as the host computer. This example configures the SDRu object to use the default address 192.168.10.2. The parameter structure <i>prmQPSKReceiver</i> sets the CenterFrequency, Gain, and InterpolationFactor arguments.</p><p><b>QPSK Receiver</b></p><p>This component regenerates the original transmitted message. It is divided into five subcomponents, modeled using System objects. Each subcomponent is modeled by other subcomponents using System objects.</p><p>1) Automatic Gain Control: Ensures that the amplitude of the input of the <b>Coarse Frequency Compensation</b> object is <i>1/Upsampling Factor</i> , so that the equivalent gains of the phase and timing error detectors keep constant over time. The AGC is placed before the <b>Raised Cosine Receive Filter</b> so that the signal amplitude can be measured with an oversampling factor of four. This process improves the accuracy of the estimate.</p><p>2) Coarse frequency compensation: Uses nonlinearity and a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to roughly estimate the frequency offset and then compensate for it. The object raises the input signal to the power of four to obtain a signal that is not a function of the QPSK modulation. Then it performs an FFT on the modulation-independent signal to estimate the tone at four times the frequency offset. After dividing the estimate by four, the <b>Phase/Frequency Offset</b> System object corrects the frequency offset.</p><p>3) Fine frequency compensation: Performs closed-loop scalar processing and compensates for the frequency offset accurately. The Fine Frequency Compensation object implements a phase-locked loop (PLL) to track the residual frequency offset and the phase offset in the input signal. For more information, see Chapter 7 of [ <a href="#9">1</a> ]. The PLL uses a <b>Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS)</b> to generate the compensating phase that offsets the residual frequency and phase offsets. The phase offset estimate from <b>DDS</b> is the integral of the phase error output of the <b>Loop Filter</b>. To obtain details of PLL design, refer to Appendix C.2 of [ <a href="#9">1</a> ].</p><p>4) Timing recovery: Performs timing recovery with closed-loop scalar processing to overcome the effects of delay introduced by the channel. The <b>Timing Recovery</b> object implements a PLL, described in Chapter 8 of [ <a href="#9">1</a> ], to correct the timing error in the received signal. The <b>NCO Control</b> object implements a decrementing modulo-1 counter described in Chapter 8.4.3 of [ <a href="#9">1</a> ] to generate the control signal for the <b>Modified Buffer</b> to select the interpolants of the <b>Interpolation Filter</b>. This control signal also enables the <b>Timing Error Detector (TED)</b>, so that it calculates the timing errors at the correct timing instants. The <b>NCO Control</b> object updates the timing difference for the <b>Interpolation Filter</b> , generating interpolants at optimum sampling instants. The <b>Interpolation Filter</b> is a Farrow parabolic filter with alpha set to 0.5 as described in Chapter 8.4.2 of [ <a href="#9">1</a> ]. Based on the interpolants, timing errors are generated by a zero-crossing <b>Timing Error Detector</b> as described in Chapter 8.4.1 of [ <a href="#9">1</a> ], filtered by a tunable proportional-plus-integral <b>Loop Filter</b> as described in Appendix C.2 of [ <a href="#9">1</a> ], and fed into the <b>NCO Control</b> for a timing difference update. The <i>Loop Bandwidth</i> (normalized by the sample rate) and <i>Loop Damping Factor</i> are tunable for the <b>Loop Filter</b>. The default normalized loop bandwidth is set to 0.01 and the default damping factor is set to 1 for critical damping. These settings ensure that the PLL quickly locks to the correct timing while introducing little phase noise.</p><p>5) Data decoder: Uses a Barker code to perform frame synchronization, phase ambiguity resolution, and demodulation. Also, the data decoder compares the regenerated message with the transmitted message and calculates the BER.</p><p>For more information about the system components, refer to the <a href="matlab:sdruqpskrx">QPSK Receiver with USRP&reg; Hardware example using Simulink</a>.</p><h2>Execution and Results<a name="6"></a></h2><p>Before running the script, first turn on the USRP&reg; and connect it to the computer.

</pre><p>When you run the simulations, the received messages are decoded and printed out in the MATLAB command window while the simulation is running. BER information is also shown at the end of the script execution. The calculation of the BER value includes the first received frames, when some of the adaptive components in the QPSK receiver still have not converged.  During this period, the BER is quite high.  Once the transient period is over, the receiver is able to estimate the transmitted frame and the BER dramatically improves. In this example, to guarantee a reasonable execution time of the system in simulation mode, the simulation duration is fairly short.  As such, the overall BER results are significantly affected by the high BER values at the beginning of the simulation. To increase the simulation duration and obtain lower BER values,  you can change the SimParams.StopTime variable in the <a href="matlab:edit('sdruqpskreceiver_init.m')">receiver initialization file</a>.</p><p>Also, the gain behavior of different USRP&reg; daughter boards varies considerably. Thus, the gain setting in the transmitter and receiver defined in this example may not be well-suited for your daughter boards. If the message is not properly decoded by the receiver system, you can vary the gain of the source signals in the <b>SDRu Transmitter</b> and <b>SDRu Receiver</b> System objects by changing the SimParams.USRPGain value in the <a href="matlab:edit('sdruqpsktransmitter_init.m')">transmitter initialization file</a> and in the <a href="matlab:edit('sdruqpskreceiver_init.m')">receiver initialization file</a>.</p><p>Finally, a large relative frequency offset between the transmit and receive USRP&reg; radios can prevent the receiver functions from properly decoding the message.  If that happens, you can determine the offset by sending a tone at a known frequency from the transmitter to the receiver, then measuring the offset between the transmitted and received frequency, then applying that offset to the center frequency of the SDRu Receiver System object.</p><h2>Appendix<a name="8"></a></h2><p>This example uses the following script and helper functions:</p><div><ul><li><a href="matlab:edit('runSDRuQPSKReceiver.m')">runSDRuQPSKReceiver.m</a></li><li><a href="matlab:edit('sdruqpskreceiver_init.m')">sdruqpskreceiver_init.m</a></li><li><a href="matlab:edit('sdruQPSKRx.m')">sdruQPSKRx.m</a></li><li><a href="matlab:edit('sdruQPSKDataDecoder.m')">sdruQPSKDataDecoder.m</a></li><li><a href="matlab:edit('QPSKCoarseFrequencyCompensator.m')">QPSKCoarseFrequencyCompensator.m</a></li><li><a href="matlab:edit('QPSKFineFrequencyCompensator.m')">QPSKFineFrequencyCompensator.m</a></li><li><a href="matlab:edit('QPSKTimingRecovery.m')">QPSKTimingRecovery.m</a></li></ul></div><h2>References<a name="9"></a></h2><p>1.

%% QPSK Receiver with USRP(R) Hardware
% This example shows how to use the Universal Software Radio Peripheral(R)
% (USRP(R)) device using SDRu (Software Defined Radio USRP(R)) System
% objects to implement a QPSK receiver. The receiver addresses practical
% issues in wireless communications, such as carrier frequency and phase
% offset, timing offset and frame synchronization. This system receives the
% signal sent by the <matlab:edit('sdruQPSKReceiver.m') QPSK Transmitter
% with USRP(R) Hardware> example. The receiver demodulates the received
% symbols and prints a simple message to the MATLAB(R) command line.

%% Implementations
% This example describes the MATLAB implementation of a QPSK receiver with 
% USRP(R) Hardware. There is another implementation of this example that uses 
% Simulink(R).
%
% MATLAB script using System objects:
% <matlab:edit('sdruQPSKReceiver.m') sdruQPSKReceiver.m>.
%
% Simulink implementation using blocks: <matlab:sdruqpskrx sdruqpskrx.mdl>.
%
% You can also explore a no-USRP QPSK Transmitter and Receiver example that
% models a general wireless communication system using an AWGN channel and
% simulated channel impairments at
% <matlab:edit('commQPSKTransmitterReceiver.m') commQPSKTransmitterReceiver.m>.

%% Introduction
% This example has the following motivation:
%
% * To implement a real QPSK-based transmission-reception environment in
% MATLAB using SDRu System objects.
%
% * To illustrate the use of key Communications System Toolbox(TM) System
% objects for QPSK system design, including coarse and fine carrier
% frequency compensation, closed-loop timing recovery with bit stuffing and
% stripping, frame synchronization, carrier phase ambiguity resolution, and
% message decoding.
%
% In this example, the SDRuReceiver System object receives data
% corrupted by the transmission over the air and outputs complex baseband
% signals which are processed by the QPSK Receiver System object. 
% This example provides a reference design of a practical digital receiver
% that can cope with wireless channel impairments. The receiver includes
% FFT-based coarse frequency compensation, PLL-based fine frequency
% compensation, timing recovery with fixed-rate resampling and bit
% stuffing/skipping, frame synchronization, and phase ambiguity resolution.

%% Initialization
% The <matlab:edit('sdruqpskreceiver_init.m') sdruqpskreceiver_init.m>
% script initializes the simulation parameters and generates the structure
% _prmQPSKReceiver_.
prmQPSKReceiver = sdruqpskreceiver_init % Receiver parameter structure
compileIt  = false; % true if code is to be compiled for accelerated execution
useCodegen = false; % true to run the latest generated code (mex file) instead of MATLAB code

%%
% To transmit successfully, ensure that the specified center frequency of
% the SDRu Receiver is within the acceptable range of your USRP(R)
% daughterboard.
%
% Also, by using the compileIt and useCodegen flags, you can interact with
% the code to explore different execution options.  Set the MATLAB variable
% compileIt to true in order to generate C code; this can be
% accomplished by using the *codegen* command provided by the MATLAB
% Coder(TM) product. The *codegen* command compiles MATLAB(R) functions to
% a C-based static or dynamic library, executable, or MEX file, producing
% code for accelerated execution. The generated executable runs several times
% faster than the original MATLAB code. Set useCodegen to true to run the
% executable generated by *codegen* instead of the MATLAB code.

%% Code Architecture
% The function runSDRuQPSKReceiver implements the QPSK receiver using
% two System objects, QPSKReceiver and comm.SDRuReceiver. 
%
% *SDRu Receiver*

% This example communicates with the USRP(R) board using the SDRu
% receiver System object. You can supply the IP address of the USRP(R)
% board as an argument when you construct the object. The IP address can be
% any address within the same sub-network as the host computer. This example
% configures the SDRu object to use the default address 192.168.10.2. The
% parameter structure _prmQPSKReceiver_ sets the CenterFrequency, Gain, and
% InterpolationFactor arguments.
%
% *QPSK Receiver*
%
% This component regenerates the original transmitted message. It is
% divided into five subcomponents, modeled using System objects. Each
% subcomponent is modeled by other subcomponents using System objects.
%
% 1) Automatic Gain Control: Ensures that the amplitude of the input of the
% *Coarse Frequency Compensation* object is _1/Upsampling Factor_ , so
% that the equivalent gains of the phase and timing error detectors keep
% constant over time. The AGC is placed before the *Raised Cosine Receive
% Filter* so that the signal amplitude can be measured with an oversampling
% factor of four. This process improves the accuracy of the estimate.
%
% 2) Coarse frequency compensation: Uses nonlinearity and a Fast Fourier
% Transform (FFT) to roughly estimate the frequency offset and then compensate
% for it. The object raises the input signal to the power of four to 
% obtain a signal that is not a function of the QPSK modulation. Then it  
% performs an FFT on the modulation-independent signal to estimate the tone  
% at four times the frequency offset. After dividing the estimate by four,
% the *Phase/Frequency Offset* System object corrects the frequency offset.
%
% 3) Fine frequency compensation: Performs closed-loop scalar processing and
% compensates for the frequency offset accurately. The Fine Frequency  
% Compensation object implements a phase-locked loop (PLL) to track the 
% residual frequency offset and the phase offset in the input signal. 
% For more information, see Chapter 7 of [ <#9 1> ]. The PLL uses a 
% *Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS)* to generate the compensating phase
% that offsets the residual frequency and phase offsets. The phase offset  
% estimate from *DDS* is the integral of the phase error output of the 
% *Loop Filter*. To obtain details of PLL design, refer to Appendix C.2 of 
% [ <#9 1> ].
%
% 4) Timing recovery: Performs timing recovery with closed-loop scalar
% processing to overcome the effects of delay introduced by the channel.
% The *Timing Recovery* object implements a PLL, described in Chapter 8
% of [ <#9 1> ], to correct the timing error in the received signal. The
% *NCO Control* object implements a decrementing modulo-1 counter
% described in Chapter 8.4.3 of [ <#9 1> ] to generate the control signal
% for the *Modified Buffer* to select the interpolants of the
% *Interpolation Filter*. This control signal also enables the *Timing
% Error Detector (TED)*, so that it calculates the timing errors at the
% correct timing instants. The *NCO Control* object updates the timing
% difference for the *Interpolation Filter* , generating interpolants at
% optimum sampling instants. The *Interpolation Filter* is a Farrow
% parabolic filter with alpha set to 0.5 as described in Chapter 8.4.2 of 
% [ <#9 1> ]. Based on the interpolants, timing errors are generated by a
% zero-crossing *Timing Error Detector* as described in Chapter 8.4.1 of 
% [ <#9 1> ], filtered by a tunable proportional-plus-integral *Loop Filter*
% as described in Appendix C.2 of [ <#9 1> ], and fed into the *NCO
% Control* for a timing difference update. The _Loop Bandwidth_ (normalized
% by the sample rate) and _Loop Damping Factor_ are tunable for the *Loop
% Filter*. The default normalized loop bandwidth is set to 0.01 and the
% default damping factor is set to 1 for critical damping. These settings
% ensure that the PLL quickly locks to the correct timing while introducing
% little phase noise.
%
% 5) Data decoder: Uses a Barker code to perform frame synchronization, phase 
% ambiguity resolution, and demodulation. Also, the data decoder compares 
% the regenerated message with the transmitted message and calculates the BER.
%
% For more information about the system components, refer to the
% <matlab:sdruqpskrx QPSK Receiver with USRP(R) Hardware example using
% Simulink>.

%% Execution and Results
% Before running the script, first turn on the USRP(R) and connect it to the
% computer. To ensure data reception, first start the
% <matlab:edit('sdruQPSKTransmitter.m') QPSK Transmitter with USRP(R)
% Hardware> example.

if compileIt
    codegen('runSDRuQPSKReceiver', '-args', {coder.Constant(prmQPSKReceiver)});
end
if useCodegen
   clear runSDRuQPSKReceiver_mex %#ok<UNRCH>
   BER = runSDRuQPSKReceiver_mex(prmQPSKReceiver);
else
   BER = runSDRuQPSKReceiver(prmQPSKReceiver); 
end

fprintf('Error rate is = %f.\n',BER(1));
fprintf('Number of detected errors = %d.\n',BER(2));
fprintf('Total number of compared samples = %d.\n',BER(3));

% When you run the simulations, the received messages are decoded and
% printed out in the MATLAB command window while the simulation is running.
% BER information is also shown at the end of the script execution. The
% calculation of the BER value includes the first received frames, when
% some of the adaptive components in the QPSK receiver still have not
% converged.  During this period, the BER is quite high.  Once the
% transient period is over, the receiver is able to estimate the transmitted
% frame and the BER dramatically improves. In this example, to guarantee a
% reasonable execution time of the system in simulation mode, the
% simulation duration is fairly short.  As such, the overall BER results
% are significantly affected by the high BER values at the beginning of the
% simulation. To increase the simulation duration and obtain lower BER
% values,  you can change the SimParams.StopTime variable in the
% <matlab:edit('sdruqpskreceiver_init.m') receiver initialization file>.
%
% Also, the gain behavior of different USRP(R) daughter boards varies
% considerably. Thus, the gain setting in the transmitter and receiver
% defined in this example may not be well-suited for your daughter boards.
% If the message is not properly decoded by the receiver system, you can
% vary the gain of the source signals in the *SDRu Transmitter* and *SDRu
% Receiver* System objects by changing the SimParams.USRPGain value in the
% <matlab:edit('sdruqpsktransmitter_init.m') transmitter initialization
% file> and in the <matlab:edit('sdruqpskreceiver_init.m') receiver
% initialization file>.
%
% Finally, a large relative frequency offset between the transmit and receive
% USRP(R) radios can prevent the receiver functions from properly decoding
% the message.  If that happens, you can determine the offset by sending a
% tone at a known frequency from the transmitter to the receiver, then
% measuring the offset between the transmitted and received frequency, then
% applying that offset to the center frequency of the SDRu Receiver System
% object.
