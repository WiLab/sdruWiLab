%% IEEE 802.11 WLAN - Beacon Frame Receiver with USRP(R) Hardware
%
% This example shows reception of beacon frames in an 802.11 wireless local
% area network (WLAN) as described in [ <#8 1> ]. The example utilizes
% USRP(R) hardware to receive radio signals and transfer to Simulink(R) for
% processing. For more information refer to <commwlan80211Beacon.html IEEE
% 802.11 WLAN - Beacon Frame> and <commwlan80211BeaconRx.html IEEE 802.11
% WLAN - Beacon Frame with Captured Data> examples.

%% Structure of the Example
% The model has three main parts: 
% 
% * |Model Parameters| block, where you can adjust several receiver
% parameters,
% * 802.11 receiver, which comprises a receiver front end, receiver
% controller, and detector,
% * Results, where you view several signals and the received information.
%
% The following describes modifications made to the model presented in
% <commwlan80211Beacon.html IEEE 802.11 WLAN - Beacon Frame Receiver with
% Captured Data> example to make it work with the USRP(R) hardware.

modelname = 'sdruwlan80211BeaconRx';

% Define Simulink(R) blocks as variables
receiver = [modelname ...
    '/Receiver'];
  
open_system(modelname);
set_param(modelname, 'SimulationCommand', 'update');

%%
% This 802.11 WLAN example includes all the receiver signal processing in
% an enabled subsystem. Connecting the |Data Len| output of the |SDRu
% Receiver| block to the enable input of the subsystem ensures that the
% receiver only processes valid data. This approach is a best practice when
% using the |SDRu Receiver| block.

%% SDRu Receiver
% 802.11 uses 1e6 symbols per second for beacon signaling. Since the
% standard [ <#8 1> ] calls for a spreading factor for 11, the chip rate
% is 11e6 chips per second. The receiver needs at least two samples per
% chip and the maximum data rate the USRP(R) hardware can pass to the host
% computer is 25e6 samples per second. Therefore, this example uses a
% decimation factor of four.
%
% Running this receiver simulation requires more time than processing the
% same data in real-time, especially when using the visualization scopes.
% To help alleviate this time requirement, the SDRu Receiver block uses
% burst mode processing.  Burst mode processing enables you to utilize the
% visualization capabilities of Simulink, while processing real data
% without the need of capturing and saving it.
%
% In burst mode, the block stores a contiguous burst of samples. The number
% of samples is determined by the values you specify for the number of
% frames in burst parameter and the frame length parameter. Each Simulink
% time step, the SDRu Receiver block sends a frame of samples to the
% Receiver subsystem. Most Wi-Fi routers use a beacon interval of 100 Time
% Units (TU), which is 102.4 msec and the beacon packet length of
% approximately 3 msec. Therefore, the receiver requires at least 106 msec
% of data to receive one beacon packet. A frame length of 3200 samples and
% 860 frames per burst, results in more than 110 msec of data, which is
% enough to receive at least one beacon packet per burst.

%% Receiver
% Since the chip rate is 11e6 chips per second, the receiver utilizes an
% *FIR Rate Conversion* block that resamples the signals to 22e6 samples
% per second. This approach provides an oversampling factor of two.

open_system(receiver)

%% Running the Example
% If the received signal is too weak or too strong, you might notice some
% garbled message output. In that case, you can change the gain of the
% *SDRu Receiver* block for better reception.
% 
% To run this example, turn on the USRP(R) hardware and connect it to the
% computer. Then, run the model. You can observe several signals in the
% scopes. The (MAC Protocol Data Unit) MPDU GUI figure shows (Physical
% Layer Convergence Procedure) PLCP and MPDU CRC status and also the
% content of correctly decoded MPDU packets.

%% Exploring the Example
% You can try different channel numbers from the *Model Parameters* block
% mask. The most widely used channels are 6 and 11.
%
% This example allows you to modify several receiver parameters through the
% *Model Parameters* block mask dialog to optimize the receiver
% performance. If you notice that the (Automatic Gain Control) AGC gain
% reaches its maximum gain even when your signal is present at the receiver
% input, increase the maximum gain of the AGC. If the AGC is slow to
% respond to changes in the input signal amplitude, increase the AGC loop
% gain. Observe the AGC behavior in the AGC scope.
%
% If your signal results in smaller peaks in the Synchronization Scope,
% which do not turn the receiver on, reduce the synchronization threshold.
