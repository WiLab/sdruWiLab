%% FM Stereo Receiver with USRP(R) Hardware
% This model shows how to use the Universal Software Radio Peripheral(R)
% (USRP(R)) device with Simulink(R) to build an FM stereo receiver. The
% model plays out the left and right channels.
%
% In order to run this model, you need a USRP(R) board with an appropriate
% receiver daughterboard that supports the FM band (e.g., TVRX or WBX).
% Please refer to <../../help/index.html Getting Started> for details on
% configuring your host computer to work with the SDRu Receiver block.

%% Structure of the Example
% This is the top-level block diagram of the model.
%%
open_system('sdruFMStereo');
set_param('sdruFMStereo', 'SimulationCommand', 'update');

%%
% The USRP(R) hardware samples its received signal at 100 Msps, then decimates
% by a factor of 500 for a resultant sample rate of 200 kHz.  Prior to FM
% demodulation, a rate converter resamples the signal again to a rate of
% 152 kHz.  This sample rate is convenient for downstream processing in the
% stereo decoder.  An FM demodulator follows the 152 kHz resampler, and is
% implemented in the same fashion as the one described in <sdruFMMono.html
% FM Monophonic Receiver with USRP(R) Hardware>.
% 
% Below is the block diagram of the stereo decoder inside the FM Receiver
% subsystem.
%%
open_system('sdruFMStereo/FM Receiver/Stereo Decoder');

%%
close_system('sdruFMStereo',0);

%%
% The peaking filter picks out the 19 kHz pilot tone, from which a 38 kHz
% carrier is created via an open loop technique.  The technique exploits
% trigonometric identities and the fact that the 19 kHz tone is sampled
% precisely eight times per cycle.  The carrier is used to downconvert the
% L-R signal, centered at 38 kHz, to baseband.  The Gain Compensation is to
% compensate for the L-R signal loss during the transmission.  A resampler
% then converts the sampling rate to 48 kHz. This rate is one of the native
% sampling rates of the output audio device.  During the rate conversion,
% the resampling filter removes the undesirable signals above 15 kHz.
% Next, the baseband L+R and L-R signals pass through a 75 microsecond
% deemphasis filter [ <#10 1> ].  Finally, a MATLAB(R) Function block
% separates the L and R signals, and the audio device plays them out.
%

%% 
% Set the Center Frequency to a local FM radio station, click the
% run button, and listen to the sound from the audio device. Change the
% Center Frequency to listen to a different station. 
%
% If you hear some dropouts or delay in the sound, run the model
% under Accelerator mode. From the model menu, select Simulation->Accelerator, 
% then click the run button. 
%

%% Results and Displays
% If you insert a Spectrum Scope block right before the 19n/6 resampler,
% the spectrum looks like the following. The black spectrum contains L+R at
% baseband, L-R at 38 kHz, and the 19 kHz tone. The red spectrum is the
% downconverted signal with L-R at baseband.
% 
% <<usrpFMStereo_Spec2.png>>
%
% The figure below shows the spectrum of the left (black) and the right
% (red) channel corresponding to the spectrum above. This spectrum
% represents music from a broadcast FM station.  There is some stereo separation
% between the left and the right channel up to 20 kHz.
%
% <<usrpFMStereo_Spec1.png>>
%
% The figure below illustrates the separation between left and right
% channels achieved by the model with a known, controlled source. It shows
% the spectrum of the left (black) and the right (red) channel for a stereo
% test signal transmitted by a hand-held FM transmitter. The test signal
% consists of a single 500 Hz tone in the left channel and a single 1 kHz
% tone in the right channel. The model achieves approximately 20 dB
% separation between left and right channels.
%
% <<usrpFMStereo_Spec3.png>>

%% Exploring the Example
% If you have your own FM transmitter that can transmit .wma files, you can
% duplicate the test that shows the channel separation result above. Load
% the |sdruFMStereoTestSignal.wma| file into your transmitter. The
% channel separation can be easily observed from the Spectrum Scope block and
% heard from the audio device. You can also adjust the Gain Compensation to
% see its effect on stereo separation.
%
% To optimize the filtering speed, you can combine the resampling filter in
% the 19n/6 resampler and the deemphasis filter into a single filter.

% *MIDI Controller for Station Selection*
%
% The <matlab:open_system('sdruFMStereoMidi') FM Stereo Receiver with
% USRP(R) Hardware and MIDI Controller> example includes a |MIDI Controls|
% block. If you have a MIDI controller connected to your computer, you can
% change the center frequency, i.e. FM radio station, using the controller.
