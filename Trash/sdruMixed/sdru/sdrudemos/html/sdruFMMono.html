%% FM Monophonic Receiver with USRP(R) Hardware
% This model shows how to use the Universal Software Radio Peripheral(R)
% (USRP(R)) device with Simulink(R) to build an FM mono receiver.  It
% performs FM demodulation, deemphasis and rate conversion.
%
% In order to run this model, you need a USRP(R) board with an appropriate
% receiver daughterboard that supports the FM band (e.g., TVRX or WBX).
% Please refer to <../../help/index.html Getting Started> for details on
% configuring your host computer to work with the SDRu Receiver block.

%% Structure of the Example
%
% The full FM receiver model is shown below:
%
open_system('sdruFMMono');
set_param('sdruFMMono', 'SimulationCommand', 'update');

%%
% The FM Receiver subsystem is also shown below:
open_system('sdruFMMono/FM Receiver');

%%
% The SDRu Receiver block takes in the baseband discrete-time complex
% samples from the USRP(R) hardware. The USRP(R) device has an ADC
% working at a 100 Msps sampling rate. The decimation factor is 500,
% resulting in an SDRu block output sampling rate of 200 kHz.  The
% deemphasis filter in the receiver is set to 75 microseconds [ <#7 1> ]
% and compensates for the preemphasis filter at the transmitter.  The
% frequency response table is given below.
% 
% <<usrpFMMono_deemp.png>>
%
% A resampler converts the sampling rate from 200 kHz to 48 kHz, a native
% sampling rate for the audio device. The resampling filter removes the 19
% kHz stereo pilot tone.
% 

%% 
% The FM demodulator is implemented as a complex difference operation
% between consecutive complex samples, as shown below:

open_system('sdruFMMono/FM Receiver/FM Demodulator');

%% 
% Set the Center Frequency to a local FM radio station, click the
% run button, and listen to the sound from the audio device.  Change the
% Center Frequency to listen to a different station. 
%
