%% QPSK Transmitter with USRP(R) Hardware
% This model shows how to use the Universal Software Radio Peripheral(R)
% (USRP(R)) device with Simulink(R) to implement a QPSK transmitter. The
% USRP(R) device in this model will keep transmitting indexed 'Hello world'
% messages at its specified center frequency. You can demodulate the
% transmitted message using the <matlab:showdemo('sdruqpskrx') QPSK
% Receiver with USRP(R) Hardware> model with an additional USRP(R) device.
%
% In order to run this model, you need to ensure that the specified center
% frequency of the SDRu Transmitter is within the acceptable range of your
% USRP(R) daughterboard. Please refer to <../../help/index.html Getting
% Started> for details on configuring your host computer to work with the
% SDRu Transmitter block.

%% Structure of the Example
% The top-level structure of the model is shown in the following figure:
modelname = 'sdruqpsktx';
open_system(modelname);
set_param(modelname, 'SimulationCommand', 'update')
%%
% The transmitter includes the *Bit Generation* subsystem, the *QPSK Modulator*
% block, and the *Raised Cosine Transmit Filter* block. The *Bit
% Generation* subsystem uses a MATLAB workspace variable as the payload of
% a frame, as shown in the figure below. Each frame contains 200 bits. The
% first 26 bits are header bits, a 13-bit Barker code that has been oversampled
% by two. The Barker code is oversampled by two in order to generate precisely
% 13 QPSK symbols for later use in the *Data Decoding* subsystem of the receiver model. The remaining
% bits are the payload. The first 105 bits of the payload correspond to the
% ASCII representation of 'Hello world ###', where '###' is a repeating
% sequence of '001', '002', '003',..., '100'.  The remaining payload bits
% are random bits. The payload is scrambled to guarantee a balanced
% distribution of zeros and ones for the timing recovery operation in the receiver model. The
% scrambled bits are modulated by the *QPSK Modulator* (with Gray mapping).
% The modulated symbols are upsampled by four by the *Raised Cosine Transmit
% Filter* with a roll-off factor 0.5. The output rate of the *Raised Cosine
% Filter* is set to be 200k samples/second.

open_system([modelname '/Bit Generation']);
%% Running the Example
% Before running the model, first turn on the USRP(R) and connect it to the 
% computer. Set the _Center frequency_ parameter of the *SDRu Transmitter* block and run 
% the model. You can run the <matlab:open('sdruqpskrx') QPSK Receiver 
% with USRP(R) Hardware> model with an additional USRP(R) device to receive 
% the transmitted signal.
close_system([modelname '/Bit Generation']);
close_system(modelname, 0);
%% Exploring the Example
% Due to hardware variations among the USRP(R) boards, a frequency offset 
% will likely exist between the USRP(R) transmitter hardware and the USRP(R)
% receiver hardware. In that case, perform a manual frequency calibration 
% using the companion frequency offset calibration 
% <matlab:open('sdrufreqcalibtx') transmitter> and 
% <matlab:open('sdrufreqcalibrx') receiver> models and examine the resulting behavior.
% 
% Since the gain behavior of different USRP(R) daughter boards also varies
% considerably, the default gain setting in the transmitter and receiver 
% models may not be well-suited for your daughter boards. If the message is
% not properly decoded by the receiver model, you can vary the gain of the 
% source signals in the *SDRu Transmitter* block of this model, and that of
% the *SDRu Receiver* block in the receiver model.
