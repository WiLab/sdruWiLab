%% Overview
% Walkie-talkies provide a subscription-free method of communicating 
% over short distances.  Although their popularity has been diminished
% by the rise of cell phones, they are still useful when lack of reception 
% or high per-minute charges hinders the use of cell phones.
%
% Modern walkie-talkies operate on the FRS/GMRS standards.
% Both standards use frequency modulation (FM) at 462 or 467 MHz,
% which is in the UHF (Ultra High Frequency) band.  The USRP(R) device in
% this example will transmit messages at either 462 or 467 MHz, in a manner
% that is compatible with FRS/GMRS devices.

%% Structure of the Example
% This is the top-level block diagram of the model:
%%
open_system('sdruFRSGMRSTx');
set_param('sdruFRSGMRSTx', 'SimulationCommand', 'update');

%% Source Signals
% Below is the subsystem of sources for the model:

%%
open_system('sdruFRSGMRSTx/Sources');

%%
% The source signal can be a pure tone sine wave, a chirp signal, or a
% multimedia file.  To switch between these sources, double-click the
% |Model Parameters| block to bring up a GUI.  This GUI also allows you to
% set the pure tone frequency or the chirp signal target/sweep time (which
% controls the duration of the chirp signal).  This example works properly
% with tones as low as 500 Hz and as high as 4 kHz.
%
% When using a multimedia file, a resampler converts the sample rate from
% 22050 Hz to 8 kHz.  This provides a convenient intermediate sample rate
% from which to resample to the final 200 kHz rate, consistent with the
% sample rate of the USRP(R) hardware in this example.
%

%% Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System (CTCSS)
% Walkie-talkies operate on a shared public channel, allowing multiple
% users to access the same channel simultaneously.  The CTCSS
% <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Tone-Coded_Squelch_System [3]>
% method filters out undesired communication or interference from these
% other users by generating a tone between 67 Hz and 250 Hz and
% transmitting it along with the source signal.  The receiver contains
% logic to detect this tone, and acknowledges a message if the detected
% tone matches the code setting on the receiver.  The receiver filters the
% tone out, so that the user will not hear the tone.
%
% The CTCSS tone generator generates a continuous phase sine wave with 
% frequency corresponding to the selected private code.  The amplitude of 
% the tone is usually 10%-15% of the maximum amplitude of the modulating 
% signal.  Note that since the maximum amplitude of all the source signals
% is 1, the default amplitude of 0.1 for the CTCSS tone corresponds to 10% 
% of the modulating signal's maximum amplitude.
% 

%% Resampler and FM Modulator
% An FIR Interpolator block converts the sampling rate of the sum of the
% modulating signal and CTCSS tone to match the USRP(R) device's sampling
% rate of 8 kHz * 25 = 200 kHz.  The resampling filter is designed using
% the MFILT object from the DSP System Toolbox.
%
% Below is the block diagram of the |FM Baseband Modulator| subsystem:
%%
open_system('sdruFRSGMRSTx/FM Baseband Modulator');

%%
close_system('sdruFRSGMRSTx',0);

%%
% The example implements the FM modulator using a simple digital IIR filter
% as an integrator.  The frequency sensitivity parameter (K) in the model
% is related to the frequency deviation (FD) by K=FD/A*(2*pi*Ts), where FD
% is 2.5 kHz, A is the maximum amplitude of the modulating signal, and Ts
% is the inverse of the sampling rate of SDRu Transmitter block, or 1/(200
% kHz) = 5e-6 seconds.  The current value of K is computed assuming A = 1.
% It should be changed if you change the signal source maximum amplitude.

%% Running the Example
% Turn on your walkie-talkie, set the channel to be one of the 14 channels 
% (numbered 1 to 14) and the private code to be either one of the 38 
% private codes (numbered 1 to 38) or 0, in which case no squelch system 
% is used and all received messages are accepted.  Note that the private
% codes above 38 are digital codes and are not implemented in this example.
%
% Set the channel and private code in the |Model Parameters| GUI so that 
% they match the walkie-talkie.  Run the model and see if you can hear the
% voice or tone output from the walkie-talkie.  If you cannot, try 
% adjusting the amplitude parameter slightly upward.  You can change the 
% channel and private code, as well as toggle between the pure tone, the
% chirp signal, and the multimedia file without stopping and restarting the 
% model.
%
% If you hear some dropouts or delay in the sound, run the model
% in Accelerator mode.  From the model menu, 
% select Simulation->Accelerator, then click the run button.  If you still
% experience dropouts or delay in Accelerator mode, try running the model
% in Rapid Accelerator mode.
%
% You can also run this model alongside an additional USRP(R) device
% running the FRS/GMRS receiver example, instead of with a commercial
% walkie-talkie.

%% Exploring the Example
% Due to hardware variations among FRS radios and the USRP(R) boards, you may
% not hear continuous transmission on your FRS radio.  In that case, you
% can vary the gain of the source signals in the |Sources| block and
% examine the resulting behavior.
% 
% Part 95.637 (Modulation standards) of the FCC wireless standards
% <http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2009-title47-vol5/pdf/CFR-2009-title47-vol5-part95.pdf
% [4]> states that the maximum frequency deviation (FD) is 2.5 kHz for FRS
% and 5 kHz for GMRS.  In practice, it is usually set to 2.5 kHz for both
% systems.  If the maximum signal amplitude increases, the frequency
% sensitivity parameter (K) should decrease.  Otherwise, the receiving
% walkie-talkie will not decode the CTCSS code correctly.  You can try to
% use a different signal with different values for K to see if your
% walkie-talkie works properly.  If FD is too large, you may not hear
% anything from your receiver when using a non-zero CTCSS private code. You
% may still hear the transmitting signal if you use code 0, which disables
% the squelch system.  This indicates that the CTCSS decoding of the
% non-zero code is not correct.
%
% You can reduce the amplitude of the CTCSS tone to determine the minimum 
% amplitude required for your receiver to work correctly.
